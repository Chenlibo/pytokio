================================================================================

This is the TOKIO Python library, which is used to connect to different sources
of I/O telemetry data and provide a (mostly) normalized interface to them.

Nomenclature
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- `connectors` establish stateful interfaces
- `grabbers` are stateless queries
